# Battrack

Battrack is a long-term battery tracker.
It saves in a SQLite DB all changes such as :
 - Battery capacity
 - AC Connected
 - Battery charging status
 - Battery charging percentage
 - etc...

Voltage variations are also temporary saved (24h).

Then, we can show this data in a web page (To do)
